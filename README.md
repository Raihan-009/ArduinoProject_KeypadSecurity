# ArduinoProject_KeypadSecurity

Basically this is a simple arduino project. 
Here we can make a simple password protected door for security purposes.

## Necessary Equipments

- Arduino 
- Servo motor
- Numpad or Matrix of Push button
- 16 * 2 lcd display with I2C(optional)
- Jumper wires
- Bread Board
- 5V adapter


Here ***Arduino*** has used as a micro controller as it has atmega328p micro controller. It has used to controll the security panel and to develop the matrix as a keypad or numpad. In addition all necessary commands has gone through by this board.
Here I have used a bunch of push button or we can say that ***matrix of push button***. By using matrix of push button I have developed this as a ***keypad*** or ***numpad*** also. 
I have also used a (16 by 2) ***lcd display*** with ***I2C*** to show something whatever I wanna show.
I have aslo used a ***servo motor*** to make door open or close when it requires.
***Jumper wires*** are used to connect one to another electronics to make the whole circuit complete.
***Bread Board*** has used to make multiple common 5V and gnd(ground) with the help of ***5V adapter***.
